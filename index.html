            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A car engine is the heart of any vehicle, converting fuel into mechanical energy to power the car. This webpage explains the different types of car engines, the essential parts, and how they work together to keep your car moving.</p>

            <h2>Types of Car Engines</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)</strong> - Most common engine type in cars, powered by gasoline or diesel.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Engine</strong> - Uses electricity stored in batteries to power an electric motor.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Engine</strong> - Combines an internal combustion engine with an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rotary Engine</strong> - Uses a rotary design instead of pistons to produce power (e.g., Mazda RX-7).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Essential Engine Parts</h2>
            <p>The internal combustion engine has several essential components that work together to keep it running smoothly. Here are some key parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pistons</strong> - Move up and down inside cylinders to convert energy into mechanical force.</li>
                <li><strong>Cylinders</strong> - Chambers where the fuel is burned and power is generated.</li>
                <li><strong>Crankshaft</strong> - Converts the up-and-down motion of the pistons into rotational motion to turn the wheels.</li>
                <li><strong>Valves</strong> - Regulate the flow of air and fuel into the engine and exhaust out.</li>
                <li><strong>Camshaft</strong> - Controls the timing of the valves' opening and closing.</li>
                <li><strong>Timing Belt/Chain</strong> - Ensures the pistons and valves move in sync.</li>
                <li><strong>Spark Plug</strong> - Ignites the air-fuel mixture inside the cylinder to start combustion.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="working-principle">
            <h2>How Engines Work</h2>
            <p>Car engines operate through a four-stroke cycle:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Intake Stroke</strong> - The intake valve opens, and the piston moves down to draw in a mixture of air and fuel.</li>
                <li><strong>Compression Stroke</strong> - The piston moves up, compressing the air-fuel mixture, making it ready for ignition.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Stroke</strong> - The spark plug ignites the mixture, causing combustion, and the piston moves down to create power.</li>
                <li><strong>Exhaust Stroke</strong> - The exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves up again, expelling the burnt gases.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding how car engines work can help you maintain your vehicle more effectively and make informed decisions when it comes to buying a car. Whether you are looking for an internal combustion engine, a hybrid, or an electric engine, each type has its advantages and drawbacks.</p>
